Here's a web scraping cheat sheet that can guide you through the process of scraping data from websites using Python. We'll cover common tasks, libraries, and code snippets for web scraping.

1. Libraries for Web Scraping
requests: To send HTTP requests and fetch web pages.
BeautifulSoup (from bs4): To parse and navigate the HTML.
Selenium: For interacting with dynamic websites (JavaScript-rendered content).
pandas: To store and process the scraped data.

2. Installing Libraries
bash
Copy code
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install selenium
pip install pandas

3. Sending HTTP Requests
import requests

url = 'http://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)

# Check the status code
print(response.status_code)  # 200 is OK
print(response.text)  # HTML content of the page
4. Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Create a BeautifulSoup object
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

# Print the parsed HTML (pretty format)
print(soup.prettify())
5. Extracting Data with BeautifulSoup
Find by tag:

# Find all <a> tags
links = soup.find_all('a')
for link in links:
    print(link.get('href'))
Find by ID or class:

# Find by id
element_by_id = soup.find(id='element_id')
print(element_by_id.text)

# Find by class
elements_by_class = soup.find_all(class_='class_name')
for element in elements_by_class:
    print(element.text)

Using CSS selectors:
# Find using CSS selector
element = soup.select('div.classname a')
print(element[0].get('href'))

Extracting Text:
# Extract text from the element
text = soup.get_text()

6. Using Selenium for Dynamic Websites
Selenium is used for scraping content rendered by JavaScript.

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Set up the browser driver (e.g., Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open the URL
driver.get('http://example.com')

# Wait for the page to load (optional, to handle dynamic content)
driver.implicitly_wait(5)

# Find elements
element = driver.find_element(By.ID, 'element_id')
print(element.text)

# Close the browser window
driver.quit()
7. Handling Pagination
To scrape data across multiple pages:

python
Copy code
for page in range(1, 6):  # Scrape 5 pages
    url = f'http://example.com/page={page}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract data from the page
    # (e.g., extracting links, items, etc.)
8. Handling Forms (Submitting Data)
To interact with forms (e.g., search):

python
Copy code
from requests.sessions import Session

session = Session()

# Send a POST request with form data
data = {'username': 'my_user', 'password': 'my_pass'}
url = 'http://example.com/login'
response = session.post(url, data=data)

# After logging in, scrape the page
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
9. Storing Data with Pandas
You can store the scraped data in a DataFrame for easy processing.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

data = {
    'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Doe'],
    'Age': [25, 30, 22],
    'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
10. Handling Exceptions
When scraping, handling exceptions is important to deal with timeouts, missing elements, or broken links.

python
Copy code
from requests.exceptions import RequestException
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

try:
    response = requests.get('http://example.com')
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx, 5xx)
    
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    # Continue scraping...
except RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
11. Throttling & Avoiding Blocks
To avoid being blocked, you should add delays between requests and mimic human browsing behavior:

python
Copy code
import time

# Delay between requests
time.sleep(2)  # Sleep for 2 seconds

# Or use headers to mimic a real browser
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.36'
}
response = requests.get('http://example.com', headers=headers)
12. Using Proxies
To avoid IP blocking or geo-restrictions, you can use proxies:

python
Copy code
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://user:password@proxyserver:port',
    'https': 'https://user:password@proxyserver:port'
}
response = requests.get('http://example.com', proxies=proxies)
13. Regular Expressions (Regex) for Extracting Data
You can use regular expressions for more advanced data extraction:

python
Copy code
import re

# Find all email addresses in the text
emails = re.findall(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}\b', soup.get_text())
print(emails)
This cheat sheet covers most of the common tasks in web scraping with Python. Always ensure that your scraping activities respect the website's robots.txt file and comply with local laws.
-----------------------------------------------
Access to tag's attribute
Summary:
.get('attribute'): Safer way to access an attribute.
tag['attribute']: Direct access, raises an error if the attribute is not found.
.attrs: To get all attributes as a dictionary.

Access to tag's text
Summary
.text: Directly accesses the text inside a tag, stripping any child tags.
.get_text(): A more flexible method that also removes child tags. You can specify a separator to join texts from nested elements.
.find(): Used to find the first occurrence of a tag.
.find_all(): Used to find all occurrences of a tag.

How to solve 403 http error

Summary of Solutions:
Set a custom User-Agent header to mimic a real browser.
Use a session to maintain headers and cookies across requests.
Use proxies to mask your IP if it's being blocked.
Handle cookies to maintain session data.
Use Selenium for dynamically rendered content or advanced bot protection.
Respect robots.txt and website terms of service.
Throttle requests by adding delays to avoid rate-limiting.
